**Full Stack Web Development Project - Chirrup**

This is the full stack website created during year 2 of my Software Engineering course.

This project uses Node.js for the backend and the Vue framework for front-end development.

Test cases written by my lecturer all pass, the website itself makes use of authorisation through headers and also is able to write to, lookup and delete from an SQL database.
